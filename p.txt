Here's a comprehensive GitHub Copilot prompt for your Chrome extension:

---

## **Chrome Extension Prompt for GitHub Copilot**

```
Create a Chrome extension for real-time interview assistance with the following detailed specifications:

## CORE ARCHITECTURE
- Manifest V3 Chrome extension
- Content script injection for video call platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams)
- Background service worker for API calls and audio processing
- Floating overlay UI with transparency and drag/resize capabilities
- Real-time speech-to-text transcription using AssemblyAI
- Multi-AI provider support (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)

## UI/UX REQUIREMENTS

### Dark Mode Implementation
- Pure dark theme with NO GLARE components
- Use dark grays (#1a1a1a, #262626) instead of pure black
- Muted white text (#e0e0e0) instead of bright white
- No shiny/reflective surfaces or glossy buttons
- Subtle shadows and borders for depth
- Low contrast mode for comfort during long interviews

### Text Size Controls
- Dynamic font size slider (12px - 24px range)
- Separate controls for questions and responses
- Persistent size preferences in Chrome storage
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Multi-AI Provider System
- Provider selector in popup: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini Pro
- Real-time provider switching in floating window
- Regenerate button with dropdown for 2 AI providers max
- Provider-specific settings (temperature, max tokens)
- Fallback system if primary provider fails

## FLOATING WINDOW SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Properties
- 40% transparency background with blur effect
- Draggable header with grip indicators
- Resizable corners with smooth scaling
- Minimum size: 300x200px, Maximum: 80% of screen
- Rounded corners (8px) with subtle border
- Always on top but respects modal dialogs

### Navigation Panel (Left Side)
- Collapsible question list: "Q1", "Q2", etc.
- Click to jump to specific question/response
- Visual indicators for answered/unanswered questions
- Context clear button with confirmation dialog
- Export conversation history option

### Response Area (Right Side)
- Real-time streaming text display
- Provider badge showing current AI service
- Regenerate button with provider selection dropdown
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Timestamp for each response

## CRITICAL STEALTH FEATURES

### Screen Share Invisibility
- Check if screen sharing is active via desktopCapture API
- Automatically hide floating window during screen capture
- Alternative: Use browser-level CSS filters to exclude from capture
- Monitor for screen recording applications (OBS, etc.)
- Fallback: Minimize to system tray notification

### Hover-Based Response Pausing
- Detect mouse enter/leave events on floating window
- Pause AI response streaming when hovering
- Buffer responses in background
- Resume display when mouse leaves
- Visual indicator showing paused state

## AUDIO PROCESSING & TRANSCRIPTION

### Real-time Audio Capture
- getUserMedia() for microphone input (user speech)
- Tab audio capture for interviewer speech
- Speaker detection logic with audio level thresholds
- WebSocket connection to AssemblyAI streaming API
- Audio chunk processing (250ms intervals)

### Speaker Identification
```
function detectSpeaker(micActive, audioLevel, source) {
  if (micActive && audioLevel > 0.3) return "user";
  if (!micActive && audioLevel > 0.2) return "interviewer";
  return "unknown";
}
```

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Question Threading
- Each question creates new thread for display
- Maintain single context for AI (all questions linked)
- Context window management (last 10 interactions)
- Smart context pruning to stay within token limits
- Question categorization (technical, behavioral, etc.)

### Data Persistence
- Chrome storage for settings and conversation history
- Session restoration on browser restart
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Export to JSON/CSV functionality
- Import previous sessions capability

## ADDITIONAL CRUCIAL FEATURES

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Ctrl+Shift+H: Toggle floating window visibility
- Ctrl+Shift+C: Clear current context
- Ctrl+Shift+R: Regenerate last response
- Escape: Pause/resume transcription

### Privacy & Security
- Local storage only (no cloud sync)
- API key encryption in Chrome storage
- Session timeout after 4 hours of inactivity
- Option to disable transcription logging
- Clear all data functionality

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of AI responses
- Request debouncing (500ms)
- Memory usage monitoring
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Efficient DOM updates with virtual scrolling

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity checks
- API rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms

### Settings Panel
- API key management for all providers
- Audio input/output device selection
- Transcription accuracy threshold settings
- UI customization options
- Backup/restore configuration

## IMPLEMENTATION STRUCTURE

### File Organization
```
/src
  /manifest.json
  /background/
    - service-worker.js
    - audio-processor.js
    - api-manager.js
  /content/
    - content-script.js
    - floating-window.js
    - audio-capture.js
  /popup/
    - popup.html
    - popup.js
    - settings.js
  /assets/
    - icons/
    - styles/
```

### Key Technologies
- WebRTC for audio capture
- WebSocket for real-time transcription
- Intersection Observer for UI optimization
- ResizeObserver for responsive floating window
- MutationObserver for DOM changes detection

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for API calls
- Mock audio input for testing
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Performance benchmarking for memory usage

Build this with modern JavaScript ES2022+, proper error handling, comprehensive logging, and production-ready code quality.
